# docs: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions

# This workflow is triggered by the Caliptra ADO nightly pipelines pushing
# pre-built HTML regression results to the `nightly-results-main` branch.
# The branch contains:
#   - directed/index.html  (results from the nightly-directed-pipeline)
#   - random/index.html    (results from the nightly-random-pipeline)
#   - index.html           (root landing page linking to both subdirectories)
# This workflow deploys the full branch tree to GitHub Pages.
