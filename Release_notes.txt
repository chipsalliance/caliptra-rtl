Pre0p8 release notes:
-	DISCLAIMER: This is NOT A BUG-FREE MODEL. This is a pre-0p8 development model that will be sync’d every week. 
    -   This model is released mainly for interface, floorplan planning purposes for consumers.
    -   0p8 release date = 03-31-2023
-	Caliptra Hardware Specification: see docs/ folder
-	Caliptra Integration Specification: see docs/ folder
-	Caliptra testplan: see docs/ folder
-	CHIPALLIANCE RISC-V Core - https://github.com/chipsalliance/Cores-VeeR-EL2/
    -   ICCM, DCCM enabled w/ 128KB each; Instruction Cache disabled; fast interrupt redirect enabled
-	Cryptos (please see the spec for NIST compliance algorithms followed)
    -   HMAC384 – Caliptra consortium provided (built based on SHA384 block below)
    -   ECC384 – Based on secp384, Caliptra consortium provided
    -   HMAC-DRBG – Caliptra consortium provided (but built using HMAC384 above)
    -   Key Vault & PCR Vault – Caliptra consortium provided
    -   SHA384/SHA512 – https://github.com/secworks/sha512
    -   Deobfuscation block – Built on https://github.com/secworks/aes but NOT ROM/FW accessible
    -   SHA256 – https://github.com/secworks/sha256
    -   Side channel attack analysis and solutions where applicable  (Plz see Caliptra IP specification for details)
-	AHB-lite internal fabric
    -   Please see spec for decoding details of various blocks
-	Key Vault, PCR Vault w/ HW PCR extension & Data Vault
-	Interrupts from all peripherals (Cryptos, SOC mailbox, IOs, timers etc.)
-	ICCM write locking
-	TAP interface
-	Idle Clock Gating
-	Impactless update reset
-	Mailbox SRAM ECC
-	Security Assert Flushing in debug unlocked & scan modes
-	SOC interface (APB, mailbox, architectural registers, fuse registers, external TRNG REQ, SHA384 acceleration) – Caliptra Consortium provided
-	Lint clean to the rules published in the integration spec
-	HTML (generated from RDLs) for all registers (internal registers, external facing architectural registers, fuse registers)
-	RTL “Frozen” IP interface;  Frozen SOC facing registers.
    -   All changes from hereon forth will require CHIPSALLIACE CALIPTRA WG approval
-	Validation Notes:
    -   DUT per crypto block and associated checkers
    -   Nightly regression on crypto blocks on-going
    -   Smoke tests for all of the above passing including bring up/boot of the caliptra IP (KV testing for ECC & SHA)
    -   UVMF for multiple DUT blocks and SOC interface

Rev rtl-caliptra_rtl_0.5.1
-   Add missing printf/ and includes/ directories to src/integration/test_suites which are required to run the tests
-   Updated Version.txt and tar.gz
