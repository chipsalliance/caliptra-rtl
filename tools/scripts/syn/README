To run DC on a design module execute the following:

module load tools/synopsys/dc/2020.09-SP1
module load tools/python/python3/3.9.2

python tools/scripts/syn/run_syn.py <name of top level block>

Example: python tools/scripts/syn/run_syn.py aes_ctrl

Outputs will be stored in $WORKSPACE/scratch/<user>/syn/<design>/latest/ folder. 
The command currently generates reports for area, area by hierarchy, timing (first 100 paths), qor, latches, sdc and sdf. Gate level netlist is also written to the output folder

TODO: 
1. Figure out the correct libraries to use
2. Some designs have errors that cause compilation to break
3. Almost all blocks have lint warnings to be resolved (since they're warnings synthesis still completes)
4. Figure out correct clock/signal constraints (uncertainty, latency, transition times). This is a first pass run so making some assumptions here
