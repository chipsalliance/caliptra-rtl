To run DC on a design module execute the following:

dc_shell -f dc.tcl -x "set design <name of top level block>" -output_log_file <log file name>

Example: dc_shell -f dc.tcl -x "set design hmac_ctrl" -output_log_file syn.log

Outputs will be stored in Caliptra/src/syn/outputs/<design>/ folder. The command currently generates reports for area, timing (first 100 paths), sdc and sdf. Gate level netlist is also written to the output folder

TODO: 
1. Figure out the correct libraries to use
2. Some designs have errors that cause compilation to break
3. Almost all blocks have lint warnings to be resolved (since they're warnings synthesis still completes)
4. Figure out correct clock/signal constraints (uncertainty, latency, transition times). This is a first pass run so making some assumptions here
