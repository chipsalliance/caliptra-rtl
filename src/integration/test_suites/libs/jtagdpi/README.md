JTAG DPI module for OpenOCD remote_bitbang driver
=================================================

This DPI module provides a "virtual" JTAG connection between a simulated chip
and [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/). It makes use of the `remote_bitbang` JTAG
driver shipped with OpenOCD, which forwards JTAG requests over TCP to a remote
server. The `jtagdpi` module is instantiated in the hardware simulation to
receive the JTAG requests from OpenOCD and drive the JTAG pins (TCK, TMS, TDI,
etc.) from it.

The `remote_bitbang` protocol is documented in the OpenOCD source tree at
`doc/manual/jtag/drivers/remote_bitbang.txt`, or online at
https://repo.or.cz/openocd.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/manual/jtag/drivers/remote_bitbang.txt
