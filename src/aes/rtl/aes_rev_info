    [aes/rtl] Correct manual operation mode for GCM
    
    This commit cleans up the generation of GCM specific start signals
    and properly handles manual operation mode for GCM. Previously, some
    GCM phases (especially the ones not using the AES cipher core) would
    start automatically despite the module being configured in manual
    operation mode.
